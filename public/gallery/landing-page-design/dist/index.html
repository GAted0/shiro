        A huge castle made of stone and steel floating in an endless sky. That
        was all this world was.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took a vagarious group of craftsmen one month to survey the place;
        the diameter of the base floor was about 10 kilometers — large enough to
        fit the entirety of Setagaya-ku within. Above, there were 100 floors

        With these conditions, the huge castle had been steadily conquered for
        two years. The current front line is the 74th floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of the castle was «Aincrad», a world of battles with swords
        that continued floating and had engulfed approximately six thousand
        people. Otherwise known as...
